Here in My Balloon
I can see things my way
Float across the room
Everybody smiling

Here in My Balloon
I am one with everything
Lighter than the Moon
Cause I am filled with Nothing

Here in My Balloon
You don't want to loose me
Gonna need a string
If you want to use me

Here in My Balloon
Nothing is ever scary
Though I'm just like you
And we are only Temporary

Here in My Balloon
(Nestle near a willing ear)
Here in My Balloon
