[00:01.96] When I was young, I fell in love with you
[00:17.47] You were my balloon
[00:24.66] When you left, I called upon a ray
[00:41.66] 
[00:39.42] Now you said the skies are gray
[00:44.51] Hoped we'd meet another day
[00:50.55] But you up and flew away
[00:56.94] I'm movin' on
[01:03.44] 
[01:04.18] Told myself that one day
[01:05.86] That I would find you
[01:08.40] My red balloon
[01:11.12] My red balloon
[01:18.12] 
[01:15.58] Said don't fly away
[01:18.63] Help me find my way
[01:21.18] When I get older, I plan to follow you
[01:35.75] In my new hot air balloon
[01:48.25] 
[01:43.83] When I'm bored I
[01:46.37] I can get so high
[01:58.27] In my champagne golden sky
