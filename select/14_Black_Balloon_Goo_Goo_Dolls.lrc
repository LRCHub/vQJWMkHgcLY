[00:29.50] Baby's black balloon makes her fly
[00:34.87] I almost fell into that hole in your life
[00:39.95] You're not thinking about tomorrow
[00:44.02] 'Cause you were the same as me but on your knees
[01:08.02] 
[01:03.10] A thousand other boys could never reach you
[01:08.55] How could I have been the one?
[01:13.31] I saw the world spin beneath you
[01:17.27] And scatter like ice from the spoon
[01:20.31] That was your womb
[01:29.31] 
[01:26.66] Coming down, the world turned over
[01:30.98] And angels fall without you there
[01:35.69] And I go on as you get colder
[01:40.07] Or are you someone's prayer?
[01:54.07] 
[01:51.90] You know the lies they always told you
[01:56.53] And the love you never knew
[02:00.91] Was it things they never showed you?
[02:04.91] That swallowed the light from the sun
[02:08.08] Inside your room, yeah
[02:19.08] 
[02:14.10] Coming down, the world turned over
[02:18.55] And Angels fall without you there
[02:23.15] And I go on as you get colder
[02:27.75] Always someone's prayer
[02:39.25] 
[02:56.55] And there's no time left for losing
[03:01.18] When you stand, they fall, yeah
[03:16.68] 
[03:04.22] Coming down, the world turned over
[03:08.72] And angels fall without you there
[03:13.23] And I go on as you get colder
[03:17.88] All because I'm
[03:20.13] Coming down, the years turned over
[03:24.50] And Angels fall without you there
[03:29.02] And I'll go on and I'll lead you home and
[03:33.63] All because I'm
[03:36.18] All because I'm
[03:38.27] And I'll become what you became to me
